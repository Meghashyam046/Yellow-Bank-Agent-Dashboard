"Yellow Bank Agent Dashboard is a modern React.js application designed for banking agents to manage customer authentication and loan accounts. The system features a multi-step authentication flow that collects phone numbers and date of birth, followed by OTP verification for security. Agents can view and select from multiple loan accounts displayed as interactive cards, access detailed loan information with rich media presentation, and collect customer satisfaction ratings through an integrated CSAT survey system. The application uses React Router DOM for navigation, React Hook Form for form validation, Framer Motion for smooth animations, and Tailwind CSS for professional styling. Mock data simulates real banking data for loan accounts, customer information, and transaction history. The design follows modern banking UI patterns with a professional blue and white color scheme, clean typography using Inter and Roboto fonts, and responsive layouts that work seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Error handling is comprehensive, covering edge cases like invalid phone numbers, expired OTPs, and missing loan data. The wizard pattern guides users through each step with clear progress indicators and validation feedback.\\n\\n**Last changes:** Initial project setup with complete authentication flow, loan management system, CSAT survey integration, and professional banking UI implementation with modern design patterns and comprehensive error handling."
